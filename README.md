# symmetric-ds
SymmetricDS is a data and file sync/replication solution. It is a platform-independent, web-enabled, and database-agnostic synchronization tool. SymmetricDS was built to replicate changes, bi-directionally, between remote or local agents.

#development
We use Eclipse for development.

To setup a development environment run the following commands:
```
cd symmetric-assemble
./gradlew develop
```

This will generate Eclipse project artifacts.  You can then import the projects into your Eclipse workspace.
